Simple (for now?) PHP wget assistant

Outline:
	* Stores config data in text file
	* Features presets for easier wget usage
	* Easy to use!

Upgrading:
	It is highly recommended that all files are removed except for presets.txt (unless you want all your presets sucked into a vicious black hole of no return)

Installation:
	1) Put files somewhere on file server
	2) Be sure that web server has read and write access to files (will alert if not)
	3) Recommended: Edit config.php (located in root of script) with custom settings
